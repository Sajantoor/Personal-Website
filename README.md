## About
This is a portfolio website to show my skills in software development and make my projects accessible. This website is built using ReactJS and is hosted using GitHub pages. The main goals were to have a unified design, an about page that breifly goes over myself, and a clean project page making projects assesible and making information such as technologies used easy to access. [ReactJS](https://reactjs.org/) is the web framework for this project. It was choosen due to its ease of creating front end components quickly with minimal code and its efficient updating and rendering.

## ðŸŽ¨ Design 
The design is something I worked particularly hard on, going through multiple designs and revisions until I was happy with a design. Unifying the seperate components in the design was something especially difficult as previous versions of the design seemed very seperated and different parts of the page seemed too distinct from one another. 

### Landing
![Landing Page](../design/Personal-Website-Landing-Page.jpg)
The landing page design was inspired by the vaporwave aesthetic as it was something I thought was visually appealing and would help me stand out if executed well. This design went through the most revisions as previous versions were not as unified and felt lacking. 

### About
![About Page](../design/Personal-Website-About.jpg)
The about section makes information accessible, providing a brief description about me, quick access to my Linkedin, GitHub or resume, and some more important information such as contact details.

### Projects
![Projects Page](../design/Personal-Website-Projects-Page.jpg) 
The projects section is the most important. Making sure information about projects is accessible while displaying projects elegantly was important. That's why projects are displayed with a large picture with big titles with subtitles that tell a little more information. Clicking to the left and right of pictures allows the user to view additional images associated with the project. 

![More](../design/Personal-Website-Projects-About.jpg)
The "MORE" button displays more information about the project, making clear what are the main technologies used with the icons, and a link to the GitHub repository assosiated with the project. 
 

## ðŸ›  Getting Started
### ðŸš¨ Please Read
I see great value keeping my website open source contributing to the open source community and allowing others to learn, growing as developers experimenting with other projects. 

If you would like to use the code from this project, you are free to do so but **please** provide credit. A lot of work was put into designing and programming for this project. As you know ***plagirism is bad*** and finding out someone copied my site, claiming it as their own would be disheartening. I did not create this website with the intention of creating a cut and paste template.

Clone or fork this repository.
```
git clone
```

Install all dependencies with [npm](https://nodejs.org/)
```
npm install
